    <h2><em>a psycho-kitty blog</em></h2>

    <p>Welcome to a blog about Ralphie and Dahlia, two psycho-kitties</p>
    <img src="img/psycho-kitties.jpg" alt="picture of two derpy cats laying on a bed" height=350px>

    <p>This is a list of some of their favorite activities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meowing <strong>uncontrollably</strong>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>at 3 am when they can tell you just hit your REM cycle</li>
        <li>at 4:30 am with complimentary headbutts, to make sure you still aren't sleeping too deep</li>
        <li>anytime you walk through the kitchen, because psycho-kitties need constant nourishment to keep up their intensity levels</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sleeping <em>all day</em>... <strong>until</strong> you go to bed</li>
      <li>Sniffing too much cat nip and derping out</li>
      <li>Listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/O52jAYa4Pm8">their favorite song</a> on full blast</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ralphie & Dahlia would like to bring attention to a very special friend Millycat and her recent, <em>shocking</em>
      <a href="millycat.html"><strong>interview</strong></a>.
